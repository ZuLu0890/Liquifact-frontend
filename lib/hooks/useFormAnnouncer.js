/**
 * useFormAnnouncer
 *
 * Returns a tuple of [announcement, announce] where:
 *   - `announcement` is the debounced string to render inside an aria-live region
 *   - `announce(message)` queues a new message (no-ops if called before mount settles)
 *
 * Behaviour
 * ---------
 * - **No announce on mount**: the first call to `announce` that happens synchronously
 *   during the initial render / effect setup is suppressed so screen readers do not
 *   speak stale or empty strings on page load.
 * - **Debounce**: rapid successive calls are collapsed — only the last message in a
 *   burst is surfaced.  Default delay is 300 ms.
 * - **aria-live "polite"**: callers should render the returned `announcement` inside
 *   an element with `aria-live="polite"` so announcements queue behind any speech
 *   already in progress.
 *
 * @param {number} [delay=300] - Debounce delay in milliseconds.
 * @returns {[string, (msg: string) => void]}
